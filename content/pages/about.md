I'm a second year student studying computer science at the University of Virginia, interested in the intersection of data and people. I currently teach an introductory data science class at [HackCville](https://hackcville.com/course/node/) and have joined clubs that have allowed me to explore computer science in an interdisciplinary fashion. This diversity will allow me to be cognizant of biases when I develop algorithms and analyze data.

On a personal note, I'm the oldest of 4 siblings, I love to run, scuba dive, and volunteer with children in STEM!
